This is a plugin for [graphql-compose](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose) family, which adds to the ObjectTypeComposer `pagination` resolver.

Live demo: [https://graphql-compose.herokuapp.com/](https://graphql-compose.herokuapp.com/)

[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-pagination/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Installation

```bash
npm install graphql graphql-compose graphql-compose-pagination --save
```

Modules `graphql` and `graphql-compose` are in `peerDependencies`, so should be installed explicitly in your app. They should not installed as sub-modules, cause internally checks the classes instances.

## Example

```js
import composeWithPagination from 'graphql-compose-pagination';
import userTypeComposer from './user.js';

composeWithPagination(userTypeComposer, {
  paginationResolverName: 'pagination', // Default
  findResolverName: 'findMany',
  countResolverName: 'count',
  perPage: 20, // Default
});
```

## Requirements

Types should have following resolvers:

- `count` - for records count
- `findMany` - for filtering records. Resolver `findMany` should have `limit` and `skip` args.

## Used in plugins
